
Notes:

    HelloMpAsm depends on HelloMp


HelloMp.cpp 

    contains the assembly code that prints "Hi!" to the screen
    directly (through 0xb800 physical address).

build-hellomp.cmd

    Creates obj/HelloMpAsm.exe in local obj/ directory.
    
load-hack.cmd

    After building the entire distribution, run load-hack.cmd so that
    the standard HelloMp executable (HelloMp.x86 from Applications/HelloMp)
    will be overwritten with HelloMpAsm.exe, then use network boot.
