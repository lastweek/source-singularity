      NetStack
      A managed code IP host implementation

This directory contains the code for NetStack.  NetStack was
developed by Yaron Weinsberg during an internship at Microsoft
Research during the summer of 2004.

The code base has since had a fair amount of hacking.  The
changes include:

- localizing code that can not work in Singularity (ie anything
  using reflection)

- replacement of types (System.Net.IPAddress -> IPv4/IPv6 classes).

- clean-up dependencies between types, factoring out base types, etc.

- addition of UDP and DHCP client code.

- Bug fixes and applying naming and coding conventions.

The code is still fairly rough, but it's a tough task to write
an IP stack in short period of time.  There is very little test
code here and this is an area that needs to be worked on if
NetStack is going to be used in the longer term.

NetStack support builds in Singularity and outside of Singularity.

Building and running outside of Singularity
===========================================

Warning: The following information is not up-to-date with the
current build system.

The top-level nmake file 'Makefile' is set up to make builds
outside of the Singularity environment.  Simply typing nmake
will build the appropriate assemblies.  Unit tests can be run
by typing 'nmake check'.

To send and receive packets in userland the PacketTap NDIS
module is needed.  It is available from:

       \\cam-01-srv\dfsroot\groups\sysperf\topology\rawether\

At the time of writing the raw ethernet driver is not connected
to the build.  The relevant file that needs to be plumbed into the
build is NetDrivers\RawEtherPacketTap.cs.

Building and running within Singularity
=======================================

The NetStack directory must be located under the top-level
Singularity source directory.  It's plumbed into the Singularity
build by the top-level makefile.  Builds from within the
directory can be performed with:

  nmake /F Makefile.Singularity

NetStack Directory Organization
===============================

Base - Base types IPv4, IPv6, EthernetAddress, NetPacket, ByteOrder.

Compat - classes that NetStack uses that are not in Singularity's Kernel BCL.

NetDrivers - Driver interface code.

Protocol - Protocol packet formats and utilities.

Runtime - Most of the code - protocol implementations, mux/demux code, etc.
